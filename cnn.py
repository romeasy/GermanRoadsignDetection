# # Training a cNN to detect roadsigns
# In order to process roadsigns in the autonomous car of the Freie UniversitÃ¤t, we want to train a
# convolutional (deep) neural network.
# 
# This network is supposed to distinguish between different classes of signs (stop, attention, train crossing etc)
# and the final model will then be integrated to the autonomos ROS structure.
# This file contains the implementation of the cNN.
# It can be run locally, though I recommend using a nice and fast GPU for that.
#
# Cuda and CuDNN should be available for efficient GPU training with tensorflow.
#
# Note further that this code relies on the data that is preprocessed by a notebook called 'preprocessing.ipynb'
